  <h2>Kitten's Adventure To a New Home</h2>
  <p>When Skye and Cloudy were first brought to their new home they were <emphasis>very</emphasis> scared. This place was new to them, so they hid in the darkest place they could find. The space under the bed was a lot like the space they knew under the dumpster, but there were these strange humans that kept putting their heads underneath to look at them. These humans carried a lot of yarn which seemed fun to play with. They gave them food and eventually Skye and Cloudy came out to eat together.</p>
